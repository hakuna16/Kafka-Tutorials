Before we get know about Kafka lets see [here] about Event Streaming.

# What is kafka ?
Apache Kafka is a community distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Initially conceived as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on an abstraction of a distributed commit log.

Kafka combines three key capabilities so you can implement your use cases for event streaming end-to-end with a single battle-tested solution:

1. To publish (write) and subscribe to (read) streams of events, including continuous import/export of your data from other systems.
2. To store streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.
3. To process streams of events as they occur.
